App-PNGCrush

The module is a simple wrapper around ``pngcrush'' program. The program
is free open source and you can obtain it from
L<http://pmt.sourceforge.net/pngcrush/> on Debian systems you
can find it in the repos: C<sudo -H apt-get install pngcrush>

I needed this module to utilize only little subsection of C<pngcrush>'s
functionality, if you would like some features added, I am more than open
for suggestions.
